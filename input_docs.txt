PvP Bot
Note: the bot does not (currently) support 1.9+ combat, combo or build mode.
Bot requires working version of Citizens. The bot doesn’t yet support combo mode, drinkable potions (splash potions of healing work). It has experimental support for golden apples. You can easily disable PvP Bot with permissions and config.yml or by removing Citizens plugin. With paperspigots, you might need to check the bot knockback in the config.yml before reporting any issues with PvP Bot's knockback.[/SPOILER]

Premium Queue and Match Limits
Premium queue:
Give your players an opportunity to purchase premium matches! Give premium matches with "/premiummatches add/set <player> <number>".

How to give extra ranked/unranked matches:
strikepractice.extrarankeds.(number)
strikepractice.extraunrankeds.(number)

Matchlimit Commands (limit daily matches per player):
/matchlimit - "/matchlimit set/add unranked/ranked <player> <number>" to modify match limits. "/matchlimit update <player>" to manually update their matchlimits (for example, after giving matchlimit permissions).

Replay
Replays require a working version of Citizens. The system saves the important actions (swinning, damage, movements etc. The playback mode will replay them) either during ranked or unranked and ranked fights.

You can easily disable replays by editing the config, removing the permissions or removing the Citizens plugin.

config.yml
messages.yml
(not up-to-date but gives you the idea)

Still not convinced? There are already many servers using this plugin and here are some with a good number of players.

test.strikepractice.ga

(use the "/sprac" command to see if they still use this plugin)

and a few hundred other servers...




This plugin supports PlaceholderAPI. You can use %strikepractice_placeholder% (For example, %strikepractice_global_elo%) or you can add more placeholders.

The plugin also supports conditional placeholders. Meaning that you can have scoreboard lines that only display in specific states. For example, only if the fight has ended or only if the fight has multiple rounds.

Use "/sprac placeholders" to search for placeholders. More on the documentation page.

This plugin supports PlaceholderAPI. You can use %strikepractice_placeholder% (For example, %strikepractice_global_elo%) or you can add more placeholders.

You may use [display=false/true] function in scoreboard. For example, a scoreboard line with [display=<sumo_started>] will only be displayed if the sumo has started. Use display=! to display when it’s false and not display when it’s true. For example [display=!<sumo_started>] will only display the line when sumo hasn’t started.

NEW: Use "/sprac placeholders" to search for available placeholders on your server.


[SPOILER="Leaderboards/Top Stats"]

Placeholders for top 10: <top_[stats][number]> and <top_[stats][number]_value>.

Example: Top 3 with "debuffelo" kit
- #1<top_elo_nodebuffelo1>: <top_elo_nodebuffelo1_value>
- #2<top_elo_nodebuffelo2>: <top_elo_nodebuffelo2_value>
- #3<top_elo_nodebuffelo3>: <top_elo_nodebuffelo3_value>


With PlaceholderAPI:

- #1%strikepractice_top_elo_nodebuffelo1%: %strikepractice_top_elo_nodebuffelo1_value%

- #2%strikepractice_top_elo_nodebuffelo2%: %strikepractice_top_elo_nodebuffelo2_value%

How to create an arena?

Type “/arena” to see all arena commands.

Use all commands without “, “<” and “>”

Type "/sprac arenasworld" to teleport to the arenas world.
Type “/arena create <arena name>” to create a new arena.
You must set the pos1, pos2, and the center.
Use “/arena pos1 <arena name>” to set the first spawn position at your current position.
Use “/arena pos2 <arena name>” to set the second spawn position at your current position.
Use “/arena center <arena name>” to set the center position at your current position.
Build arena creation: Use “/arena build <arena name>” to toggle the build mode. Build kits will only go to build arenas and non-build kits will only go to non-build arenas by default
Tip: After creating a new arena, set "/arena corner1 <arena>" and "/arena corner2 <arena>" so you can use "/arena copypaste <arena>" to clone the arena. Note that this can not be undone.
[SPOILER="Advanced"]

Advanced users:

Use  “/arena kits <arena name> <kit name>” to specify a kit. After doing this only specified kits will go to this arena and no other kit will lead there and the specified kits will only go to the arenas that have the kit specified. To make a spleef arena type  “/arena kits <arena> <spleef kit>”.

You can also set “/arena corner1 <arena name>” and “/arena corner2 <arena name>”. The corners are used for some features but are not required. These locations should be in opposite corners and the other should be at the bottom of the arena and the other at build limit or at the top of the arena.
[/SPOILER]


How to setup a FFA arena?
1.   Create a normal arena (follow the arena creation tutorial)
2.   Use /arena kits to specify the kit.
3.   Use /arena ffa. The arena will no longer be used for other fights.
4.   Restart the server and use /<arena name> to join the arena.
Note the command is not actually a real command.



How to setup a kit?

Type “/battlekit” to see all kit commands.

Use all commands without "<" and ">"

Use “/battlekit create <kit name>” to create a new kit. If possible, the system will automatically create a kit with inventory and armor based on the kit's name. You can add “uhc” in the name to disable health regeneration or "sumo" and water will kill instantly.
If you don't like the kit it created automatically use the following commands:
Use “/battlekit setinv <kit name>” to set the inventory, armor and potion effects.
Use “/battlekit seticon <kit name>” to set the kit’s icon. Hold the item in your hand. You can rename the item in your hand with “/sprac rename &cExample_name”. “_” will be replaced with a whitespace.
Use “/battlekit build <kit name>” to toggle whether the kit is a build kit.
You can easily create a ranked kit from unranked kit with “/battlekit rankedcopy <kit to copy> 1v1”.
Premium Queue: Use "/battlekit types premium <kit name>" to add the kit to the premium queue inventory.

Advanced kit options:

"/Battlekit bedwars <kit name>" to enable bedwars. Place a bed near both spawn points
"/Battlekit healthbar <kit>" to enable health bar under nametags.
You can use “/battlekit combo <kit>” (players can be hit a lot faster).
You can use “/battlekit horse <kit>” (players will spawn with a horse).
You can use “/battlekit bow <kit>” (players can’t pvp, only projectiles are allowed, good for spleef kits).
If you want you can make the kit editable with “/battlekit editable <kit>”
Use "/battlekit stickspawn <kit>" if you don't want players to leave spawn before countdown has ended (for example sumo).
Use “/battlekit chestaccess <kit>” to toggle whether people can add new items when editing the kit.
Use “/battlekit types <kit> <type>” to specify types. <type> can be: any, duel, bot, queue, party-ffa, party-split or party-vs-party. You can also use "/battlekit types <kit> !bot" to add all types except bot.
To allow breaking more blocks (spleef for example) type “/battlekit extramaterial <kit>“ and hold the item in your hand. For example, “/battlekit extramaterial spleef” and hold a snowblock.
Use /battlekit rankedcopy instead! (Or use “/battlekit mergeeditedkits <kit name> <some editable kit>” if you want to have one editable kit for two or more kits. When giving <kit name> the <some editable kit>’s edited version will load (or default if the player hasn’t edited the kit). Example: “/battlekit mergeeditedkits potionelo potion” and be sure “potion” is editable. This will result with one editable kit for both ranked and unranked kits.)
[/SPOILER]


How to setup a kit editor?

You can change the lines in the config.
Use “/sprac setediting” to set the kit editing place.
Place an anvil near the editing place. Right clicking it will open the GUI for editing kits.
Place a door near the editing place. You can right click the door to exit the kit editor.
You can place a chest at the editing place to give players access to take more items (for example more speed potions). This requires that the kit has “chestaccess” (“/battlekit chestaccess <kit name>”)
Optionally you can also:
Place a sign and type “[Reset Kit]” in the first line. Players can click this sign to reset their kit.
Place a sign and type “[Leave Editor]” in the first line. Players can click this sign to teleport to the spawn.
The lines can be edited in the config.yml and use the config's lines
[SPOILER="Legacy Kit Editor"]
To only allow one edit per kit set "legacy-kit-editor: true" in the config.yml. Place a sign and type “[Save Kit]” in the first line. Players can click this sign to save their kit.
[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]


[SPOILER="Sign Stats"]
Place a sign.
The first line must always be '[stats]'.
Choose the other line:

“kills” for kills
“deaths' for deaths
“lms' for last man standing event wins
“party” for party vs party wins
“brackets” for brackets event wins
“elo” and third line: the name of the kit
NOTE: You can only have one sign for each statistic
[/SPOILER]

You can use Holographic display with PlaceholderAPI for leaderboards.
StrikeTab allows top stats in the tablist.

Website Leaderboards



Replace <event> with the event you are hosting. (LMS, brackets, juggernaut or KOTH, e.g /lms, /brackets).

Hosting events:
Simply /events (easy for VIPs)
or use "/hostevent <event>" to automatically open the event, broadcast and start the event. If you have "strikepractice.hostevent.anykit" permission you can use "/hostevent <event> [kit name]" (only lms, brackets and koth)

Players:
Players can join an open event with “/<event> join” and leave it with “/<event> leave” or by clicking the broadcast message.

[SPOILER="How to setup & Automatic Events"]
Automatic Events

Setting up automatic events should not be difficult, here's a copy from the config.yml. You can add events and change the messages, and specify the kits that will be used in automatic events.

[code]
automatic-events:
 broadcast:
  #How often should the message be sent
  delay: 10
  #How many times should the message be sent
  times: 5
  #The messages for all events
  lms: '&cLMS event is starting soon! Type /lms join!'
  brackets: '&cBrackets event is starting soon! Type /brackets join!'
  juggernaut: '&cJuggernaut event is starting soon! Type /juggernaut join!'
  koth: '&cKoth event is starting soon! Type /koth join!'
 #Default kits when hosting an automatic event
 juggernaut-kit: gapple
 juggernaut-player-kit: potion
 koth-kit: potion
 lms-kit: soup
 brackets-kit: potion
 sumo-kit: sumo
 # Use "times: []" and remove the scheduled times under it to disable
 times:
 #Format like this: time:lms (for example 15:30:lms)
 #LMS, koth, brackets, juggernaut
  - '15:30:lms'
[/code]

Sumo Event
Main command to manage sumo is “/sumo”. Before you can start a sumo event you should create a new arena named “sumoevent” (see “Arena Creation” for help).
After that, you must set the sumo lobby with “/sumo setlobby”.

Brackets Event (1v1 tournament)
Main command to manage brackets is “/brackets”. Before you can start a brackets event you should create a new arena named “brackets” (see “Arena Creation” for help).
